# Module #2 - JavaScript

1. **Fundamental concepts in programming**. While we're using JavaScript to illustrate these concepts, it's important to keep in mind that what you will learn is applicable to **any** programming language. They might differ in syntax (a fancy term for the arrangement of words in a language in order for it to make sense), but the functionality will be the same: a loop will always be a loop.

This should be your mindset when you're learning concepts: **I'm learning how to become a software developer that can adjust to any language used, because I know what the underlying principles and concepts are**.

2. **How to think like a programmer**. In one sentence this means: knowing how to solve problems computationally. Let's split that up in two parts: `how to solve problems` refers to the ability to identify issues and find effective solutions. `computationally` refers to the ability to think in logical steps that the computer can understand and execute.

This should be your mindset when you're learning how to think : **I'm learning how to think in logical steps, identifying cause and effect, and always looking for solutions**.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Have an idea of what `computer programming` is
- Know the basic building blocks of `JavaScript`
- Correctly write and use `variables`, `functions` and `loops`
- Understand the `control flow`
- Be able to solve worded problems using code

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 2 essential parts for each week:

1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the weekly assignment. It contains the list of concepts that you will want to study this week and points you to your study book to read all about them. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's practical tasks / assignment. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier. In the first two weeks we do not expect you to hand in any assignment as the online resources already check the code automatically, from week 3 our mentors will start giving you feedback on your assignments.
